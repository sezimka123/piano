# piano
I always wanted to learn playing the piano, but I had so many issues and couldnâ€™t go to musical schools or courses. 
Playing the piano incorporates many unnatural skills that would scare any beginners away, such as using both hands, sight-reading their music, and recognizing musical symbols. Struggling with their hand-eye coordination, lack of ability to respond to auditory stimuli, and the music notation for their right hand that is different from the one for their left hand, beginners can be easily intimidated.
Alongside with being able assist in playing music, piano project will be able to give lessons to players, follow them to learn how to play the piano at their own pace. Program will act as a personal private tutor that will be available whenever the player wants to learn.
